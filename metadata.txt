about=This plugin contains implementation of 11 popular topographic correction algorithms: Cosine-T, Cosine-C, C-correction, SCS, SCS+C, Minnaert correction, Minnaert-SCS, Pixel-based Minnaert, VECA, Teillet regression and Pixel-based C correction. Besides it the plugin provides an ability to evaluate the results of the correction algorithms by several methods: correlation between luminance and image digital numbers, rose-diagrams analysis and multi-criteria statistical analysis. Also, the plugin is capable of ranking topographic correction algorithms according to their applicability to a particular image using multi-criteria score based on the statistical metrics. Terraform plugin has processing provider, so you can easily combine the algorithm described above with other processing algorithms.
